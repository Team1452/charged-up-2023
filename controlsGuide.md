# Rex Notes
But basically
- Stick left and right turn the robot

- Stick forward and back drive the robot forward and back

- Button 2 controls the sensitivity of the movement, maybe just have it be if the button is being held then the controls only move the robot half or a quarter as much as normal

- Buttons 7-12 for whatever automation you guys want to put in that Lany isn’t controlling directly (at the very least the buttons for rotating the arm back to the starting position and then rotating it back out so that we don’t have to manually do it each time) 

Anything we need to control that I missed?
Also do you think we’ll have automated positioning at the tournament or nah?
